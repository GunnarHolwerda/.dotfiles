description: Create the weekly team agenda of what was completed last week
---

I would like for you to load up the latest completed Linear cycle, review all completed tickets and then build quick bulleted summary of completed tasks by developer.

This list will be placed as a status update in a company meeting agenda document, the focus of the update you should write should be around the projects that were worked on and the progress that was made along with any customer facing bugs. Below your report please include the items that you chose not to include so that I can review them and see if they should have been included or not.

Don't use the ticket names to refer to the tickets instead use natural language that other people in our company could understand.
