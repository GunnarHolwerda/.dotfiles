## Your Task

Your job is to come up with a plan for implementing Linear ticket EM1-$ARGUMENTS.

Please review the ticket and all of the comments on the ticket which may give guidance on how to implement it. Think deeply about what is being asked and then begin working on implementing the ticket explicitly working to meet the requirements and guidelines in the ticket.

If in your review you think that the simplest implementation would cause issues please pause and ask the user for clarification for guidance.
